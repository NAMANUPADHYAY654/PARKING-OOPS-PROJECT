As cities grow, parking systems are unable to keep up with the increasing number of vehicles. Wasteful manual parking management leads to time delays, incorrect pricing, and misallocated places. The Car Park Manager solution is a software-driven solution that ensures dependability and efficiency by automating these tasks. The initiative, which was developed using C++, aims to provide scalability and an easy-to-use user interface while addressing the operational problems of traditional systems. By automating these processes, the solution ensures reliable operations, optimal resource use, and efficiency. Designed to be scalable and equipped with a user-friendly interface, it is tailored to meet the demands of urbanization and integrates seamlessly with future smart city technologies.
